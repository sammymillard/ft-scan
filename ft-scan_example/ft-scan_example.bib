	abstract = {Background: Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, is known to activate the electroencephalogram (EEG), despite its sedative effects. Spindle oscillations are known to be related to the sedative actions of the reticular thalamic nucleus with links to thalamocortical neurons. This study was designed to examine the effect of ketamine on the spindle oscillations to understand the simultaneous sedative effect and EEG activation that occurs with ketamine, by comparing the EEG in emergence. Methods: Anesthesia was induced with propofol using a target-controlled infusion (TCI) system (3.5 μg/ml). Seventeen patients, scheduled for non-cranial surgery under general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia, were randomly divided into two groups: (i) anesthesia was maintained with TCI-propofol alone (n = 8) and (ii) anesthesia was maintained with TCI-propofol and intravenously administered ketamine (n = 9). The EEG was continuously monitored and EEG indices and power spectra were determined. Results: Propofol alone caused the α-peaks of the power spectra to occur at an average frequency of 10.4 ± 0.9 Hz; the addition of ketamine shifted the peaks to higher frequencies of 15.1 ± 1.4 Hz (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). On the other hand, when the EEG was activated by discontinuation of propofol, the corresponding α-peaks disappeared. Conclusions: Ketamine increased the frequencies of α-spindle waves induced by propofol, but did not block their formations. The phenomena have the possibility to underlie the cooperative effect between propofol and ketamine concerning sedation and anesthesia. © 2007 Acta Anaesthesiol Scand.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investiagate to what extent cortical excitability is altered in GTS patients by means of event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS). Background(s): Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterised by multiple tics. The pathophysiology of GTS is associated with a dysfunction of the basal ganglia possibly yielding cortical excitability changes. Accordingly, in GTS-patients alterations of motor cortex (M1) excitability have been evidenced. Furthermore, sensory processing might be altered in GTS-patients causing increased sensitivity to sensory stimulation. During voluntary movements and sensory stimulation a typical pattern of ERD and ERS occurs. ERD has been associated with an increased excitability of the sensorimotor cortex, whereas ERS may represent cortical deactivation. Method(s): In a first study, 11 GTS-patients and 11 control subjects performed a self-paced finger movement task. In the second study an electrical stimulation was applied to the median nerve of 12 GTS-patients and 12 control subjects. During both tasks neuromagnetic activity was recorded using a 122-channel whole-head magnetoencephalography system. Temporal spectral evolution was calculated for the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-24 Hz) frequency band, respectively. Result(s): In the movement task, ERD at beta frequency was significantly increased in the contralateral hemisphere in GTS-patients before and during movements. The ERS following movement termination was significantly increased in the ipsilateral M1 and was inversely correlated with tic severity. In contrast, after median nerve stimulation ERD and ERS of the somatosensory cortex in both hemispheres were significantly reduced in GTS-patients at alpha-frequency. Conclusion(s): Our data provide evidence for a pattern of increased activation followed by increased inhibition during voluntary movements. We speculate that the increased activation of contralateral M1 might be related to tic generation whereas increased inhibition of ipsilateral M1 might reflect compensatory activity to suppress tics. The reduced alpha modulation after median nerve stimulation might represent an adaptive mechanism of the somatosensory cortex to inhibit sensory input.},

	abstract = {Experienced Qigong meditators who regularly perform the exercises "Thinking of Nothing" and "Qigong" were studied with multichannel EEG source imaging during their meditations. The intracerebral localization of brain electric activity during the two meditation conditions was compared using sLORETA functional EEG tomography. Differences between conditions were assessed using t statistics (corrected for multiple testing) on the normalized and log-transformed current density values of the sLORETA images. In the EEG alpha-2 frequency, 125 voxels differed significantly; all were more active during "Qigong" than "Thinking of Nothing," forming a single cluster in parietal Brodmann areas 5, 7, 31, and 40, all in the right hemisphere. In the EEG beta-1 frequency, 37 voxels differed significantly; all were more active during "Thinking of Nothing" than "Qigong," forming a single cluster in prefrontal Brodmann areas 6, 8, and 9, all in the left hemisphere. Compared to combined initial-final notask resting, "Qigong" showed activation in posterior areas whereas "Thinking of Nothing" showed activation in anterior areas. The stronger activity of posterior (right) parietal areas during "Qigong" and anterior (left) prefrontal areas during "Thinking of Nothing" may reflect a predominance of self-reference, attention and input-centered processing in the "Qigong" meditation, and of control- centered processing in the "Thinking of Nothing" meditation. © Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag 2012.},

	abstract = {Music is a stimulus which may give rise to a wide range of emotional and cognitive responses. Therefore, brain reactivity to music has become a focus of interest in cognitive neuroscience. It is possible that individual preference moderates the effectof music on the brain.In the present study we examined whether there are common effects of listening to music even if each subject in a sample chooses their own piece of music.We invited 18 subjects to bring along their favorite relaxing music, and their favourite stimulating music. Additionally, a condition with tactile stimulation on the foot and a baseline condition (rest) without stimulation were used. The tactile stimulation was chosen to provide a simple, non-auditory condition which would be identical for all subjects. The electroencephalogram was recorded for each of the 3 conditions and during rest.We found responses in the alpha range mainly on parietal and occipital sites that were significant compared to baseline in 13 subjects during relaxing music, 15 subjects during activating music, and 16 subjects during tactile stimulation. Most subjects showed an alpha desynchronization in a lower alpha range followed by a synchronization in an upper frequency range. However, some subjects showed an increase in this area, whereas others showed a decrease only. In addition, many subjects showed reactivity in the beta range. Beta activity was especially increased while listening to activating music and during tactile stimulation in most subjects.We found interindividual differences in the response patterns even though the stimuli provoked comparable subjective emotions (relaxation, activation), and even if the stimulus was the same for all subjects (somatosensory stimulation). We suggest that brain responsivity to music should be examined individually by considering individual characteristics. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The simulated experiment of heliox dive to 31ATA in four subjects was performed for one month including the pressure holding for one week. In order to study the influence of hyperbaric environment on physical condition and level of consciousness, microvibration (MV) on thenar and eyelid and electroencephalogram (EEG) on T4 and O2 were measured at various atmosphere conditions. The power spectrum of MV and EEG were calculated: The peak frequency of power spectrum and the magnitude of power spectrum at the peak frequency were evaluated. The amplitude of MV increased after compression as compared with the value of pre-compression i.e., 1ATA, and the tendency was emphasized on eyelid MV at post-compression i.e., 1ATA, whereas the peak frequency of MV did not change significantly throughout the experiment. A remarkable hyperbaric effect was found in the evaluation of EEG peak frequency; The lowering of the peak frequency was recognized during the process of compression, pressure holding, and decompression. As the high pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS), especially during compression, was not recognized here, MV was not used as a detector of omen of HPNS, but the hyperbaric effect on skeletal muscle was found in ballistocardiogram component of MV due to the increase of the amplitude at post-compression. EEG denoted the lowering of level of consciousness during pressure holding, so that the result meant calling one's attention to the operation in hyperbaric environment of 31ATA.},

	abstract = {Recordings of neurophysiological brain responses to noxious stimuli have been traditionally based on short stimuli, in the order of milliseconds, which induce distinct event-related potentials (ERPs). However, using such stimuli in the experimental setting is disadvantageous as they are too brief to faithfully simulate clinical pain. We aimed at utilizing continuous EEG to investigate the properties of peak alpha frequency (PAF) as an objective cortical measure associated with subjective perception of tonic pain. Five minute long continuous EEG was recorded in 18 healthy volunteers under: (i) resting-state; (ii) innocuous temperature; and (iii) psychophysically-anchored noxious temperature. Numerical pain scores (NPSs) collected during the application of tonic noxious stimuli were tested for correlation with peak frequencies of alpha power-curves derived from central, temporal and frontal electrodes. NPSs and PAFs remained stable throughout the recording conditions (RM-ANOVAs; Ps {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.51). In the noxious condition, PAFs obtained at the bilateral temporal scalp were correlated with NPSs (Ps {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). Moreover, resting-state PAFs recorded at the bilateral temporal scalp were correlated with NPSs reported during the noxious condition (Ps {\textbackslash}textless 0.01). These psychophysical-neurophysiological relations attest to the properties of PAF as a novel cortical objective measure of subjective perception of tonic pain. Moreover, resting-state PAFs might hold inherent pain modulation attributes, possibly enabling the prediction of individual responsiveness to prolonged pain. The relevance of PAF to the neural processing of tonic pain may indicate its potential to advance pain research as well as clinical pain characterization. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
